This is a derivative of the [simple d3.js graph](http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/b3ff6ae1c120eea654b5) used as an example in the book [D3 Tips and Tricks](https://leanpub.com/D3-Tips-and-Tricks). The stock data was sourced from Mike Bostock's [small multiples example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1157787).

It is the fourth graph in a series that is building a multi-line graph that incorperates an automatically developed legend and a system that can toggle the lines off and on as desired.

This version is demonstrating the ability to toggle the lines off and on by clicking on the appropriate legend text.

The graph should be taken in context with the text of the [book](https://leanpub.com/D3-Tips-and-Tricks) which can be downloaded for free from Leanpub.
